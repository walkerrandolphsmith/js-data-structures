Binary trees are a type of tree which is a type of graph used to store comaparable data such that all elemnts on the left subtree are less than a node and all elements on the right subtree are greater than a node.

`isEmpty()` Determine if there are any elements in the tree.

`getData()` Retreive the element at the root of the tree.

`isLeaf()` Determine if the tree is a leaf node.

`getLeftSubtree()` Retrieve the tree that is the left child of the current root node.

`getRightSubtree()` Retrieve the tree that is the right child of the current root node.
